The heroes immersed themselves in the festival of the blazing sun. Caryn dunked a townsperson while Kavi rocked out the b pop serenade. Rollo spotted his old friend Morgantha selling her pastries. The party trailed Morgantha and ambushed her outside of town. After an exchange of spells, the companions were forced to let sleeping dogs lie, as Morgantha escaped their grasp. Kavi lock picked his way into Wachterhaus where they found one of the fabled Barovian artifacts. The mighty Sunsword is now in the party’s possession. Returning to the town center, the festival was interrupted by a loud CRASH from the east side of town. A distraught Rictavio asked for help, and the adventurers agreed to help him and his saber tooth tiger disappear. More trouble was afoot at the Church of St. Andral, where the Saint’s bones had been stolen. We return to action where Gilgan, hot on the trail of the missing bones of St. Andral, has awoken six pairs of red eyes which now stare at him and the others hungrily.
