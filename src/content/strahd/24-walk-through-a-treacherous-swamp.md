After bringing in some nice revenue to Gunther’s shop, the party stopped by to visit Blinksy who had taken a tumble down the stairs. Continuing along to the swamplands, Gilgan met with Muriel the Wereraven who gave him the lay of the land. Gilgan took flight and searched from above, but could not see beneath the murky water, where poisonous snakes lay in wait. Kavi spent some time underwater getting acquainted with the snakes but Rollo, the snake slayer, ended Kavi’s swamp bath. Gilgan and Oink hunted down the scarecrows and eventually they met with the master of the swamp - Baba Lysaga. Gilgan’s first act was to attempt to free his raven brethren, and Kavi lent a hand in the form of his magic missiles. The ravens swarmed Baba, and caused her to lose focus on the black tentacles that had just grappled Caryn and Kavi. The swamp witch tried and failed to charm Rollo who wiped sweat from his brow, marveling at his good fortune. Rollo booped a scarecrow on the head as Baby Lysaga mounted her flying skull and flew above the others. She willed her hut to take up arms… and roots against the adventurers, and the enormous tree stump has come to life, a faint glowing can be discerned from within.

After awakening the hut, Baba begins to shrink in size, and soon she joins the ranks of the angry insects that hover above the battle, indistinguishable from the swarm.
