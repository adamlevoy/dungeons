Shadows cloaked the coffin maker's shop where a battle raged on. Ireena unsheathed the sun blade but the light was quickly dispersed as a vampire spawn snatched it from her grasp. Gilgan cleaved into the dark beings with his black battleaxe and Rollo’s eldritch magic destroyed one of them. Caryn joined the fray and let the holy powers flow through the icon of Ravenloft. The vampires fled in terror but mercy was not on her mind. Caryn assaulted the evil with the help of her spiritual weapon, and a throng of spirit guardians. Only two vampires were able to escape into the night. Feeling weary, the adventurers sought a rest at the Blue Tavern Inn. Kavi returned the clockwork doll to Blinksy and earned his allegiance. The party ventured to Rictavio’s tower only to learn that the ringleader was in fact, the famous monster hunter Rudolph Van Richten! Van Richten provided some details about Strahd’s past, revealing that the source of his power came from the Amber Temple. Rudy gave the party some holy water, and silvered some of their weapons before saying goodbye. The party now contemplates their next move in the vastness of the Barovian Valley.
