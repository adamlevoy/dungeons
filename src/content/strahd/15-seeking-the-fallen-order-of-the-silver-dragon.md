The Barovian bunch came across a lone revenant on the hunt for Strahd’s minions. He told them to seek out Vladimir Horngaard of the fallen Order of the Silver Dragon. The party was ambushed by Werewolves along the way. Gilgan and the revenant held down the front line, but the wolves attacked from all sides. Kavi’s magic missiles caused one of the beasts to fizzle, but both he and Caryn have been feeling an insatiable itch behind their ears since the encounter. Arriving at the ruined mansion where the Order once convened, the party met Ezmerelda de Avenir. Ez was exploring the ruins as well. Kavi discovered a living flame inside an old fireplace, and Gilgan snuffed it out. Oink swore to the group that he wasn’t afraid of spiders after encountering a room full of them. A gruesome sight awaited the team, behind a velvet curtain - was Gilgan’s severed head! Shaking off the shivers, the party made their way to the top floor, where Vladimir and his knights resided. Vladimir explained the nature of his torment, and why he has forbidden any to end Strahd’s suffering. Our heroes may need some help persuading the lead knight of the Order to go on the offensive. Who will they turn to? Let’s find out…
