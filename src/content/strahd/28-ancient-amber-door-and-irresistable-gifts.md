Not so long ago… our heroes found themselves in a dire situation. Kavi, the master illusionist, harnessed his arcane powers to summon an ethereal image of Sangzor. This mesmerizing illusion rallied several of the mountain folk into battle.

Meanwhile, Caryn, Gilgan, and Oink sought refuge from the fiery devastation that was raining down from afar. Amidst the chaos, Rollo stumbled upon a powerful arcane item, the staff of frost.

As the party explored deeper into the temple's cryptic chambers, Gilgan's eyes fell upon a certain door made of ancient amber. He contemplated the unimaginable gifts that may reside within, their allure almost irresistible. Oink and Caryn, with unwavering determination, resisted the seductive pull emanating from the dark vestiges lingering behind the door.

Rollo and Kavi's journey took an unexpected twist when they stumbled upon a chamber, unlike any other they had encountered—a luxurious banquet hall. Set upon a fancy table, a mouthwatering feast awaited them, a stark contrast to the perilous conditions of late.
