Gilgan completed Odin’s errand, retrieving the bloodspear and Kavi located the first magic gem, created by the Wizard of Wines - but he handed the gem over to Strahd, who was watching them from the Ethereal plane. Strahd promised to return the gem to the Barovian Bunch, on the condition that they dine with him at Castle Ravenloft. Nervous at the prospect of meeting their great adversary in his lair, the party stocked up. Kavi collected some studded leather, Caryn curried Lathander’s favor, and Rollo bargained with the Burgomaster. The heroes arrived at Castle Ravenloft via a driverless black carriage. The ominous sound of organ music beckoned them inside the halls. Strahd invited the group to explore the castle - and to seek out his servant Cyrus when they were ready to rest. Gilgan discovered several powerful artifacts at the chapel, and the party was reunited with their lost companions… Lohar and Wyn now march against their former allies with fire burning in their eyes…
