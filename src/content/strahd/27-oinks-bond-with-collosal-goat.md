In our last session, Gilgan stumbled upon Rollo, frostbitten and confused. Reuniting him with the others, the party pushed onwards.

A unique bond was formed between Oink and a colossal goat, the creature's distress soothing under Oink's gentle touch. Reaching the Amber Temple, Gilgan discovered a fissure that led to a clan of mountain folk.

After the fervor had subsided, the party found solace in rest, gathering strength for the journey that lay ahead. Upon awakening, Oink's curiosity led him through the doors to the main temple chamber, descending a stone staircase with trepidation, Caryn was met with a fiery surprise. Meanwhile Kavi discovered a corridor guarded by flameskulls.

If that were not enough, a pool of molten lava has just surged forth, as if drawn from the very depths of the earth. The air grows charged with tensionâ€¦
