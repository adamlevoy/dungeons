Leaving the walls of Vallaki behind for the meantime, the travelers decided to look into the valley’s wine shortage problem. They were met by a Vistani search party on the lookout for a missing child. Rollo found the girl’s stuffed bear, which led to her captor. Caryn and Kavi rescued the girl from a delusional fisherman who had kidnapped the girl for good luck. Returning Arabelle to a nearby Vistani camp, the rescuers were rewarded by her father, Luvash. Rollo and Oink met the dusk elves and learned of the location of the Amber Temple. One of the Vistana offered to guide the party to the Vineyard, and supplied them with horses for quicker means of travel. Arriving at the Wizard of Wines, the Vistana was caught snooping in Oink’s belt pouch. After an exchange of charms and curses, Gilgan got some poison, and Oink got a nose job. Twig blight troops arrived from the East, mostly falling victim to Gilgan’s new axe. Caryn summoned a spiritual dagger and stabbed at some ravens, we return to the action, Ireena has fallen unconscious…
