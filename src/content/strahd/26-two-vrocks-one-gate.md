Last time, Gilgan bravely passed through an ancient gate at Tsolenka Pass, awakening two vrocks. Kavi hurled some savage mockery towards the creatures, while Caryn casted some supporting magic. O

ink put Marina's bow to great use, and Rollo unleashed a slew of eldritch blasts, sending one vrock tumbling down the mountainside. A decisive blow from Gilgan beheaded another vrock.

Unfortunately, Oink injured his shoulder while dealing with a stubborn door, but Gilgan skillfully hacked through it.

Seeking refuge, the group rested inside a guard tower where Kavi had a spiritual encounter with Blue Belle, the mysterious feline spirit.

Continuing on their way, the party met with a gargantuan airborne creature. A Roc! It swooped down, in an attempt to seize Caryn but settled instead for Rollo, who had polymorphed into a giant ape.

Despite multiple blasts targeting the Roc, it managed to escape, carrying Rollo in its clutchesâ€¦
