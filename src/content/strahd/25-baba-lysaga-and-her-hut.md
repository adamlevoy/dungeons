The battle of Berez raged on as Baba’s creeping hut demonstrated its pulverizing power, slamming its roots into the party.

Rollo took a giant boulder to the head, and Kavi took another swamp mud bath. Caryn knocked Baba out of her insect form as Oink scaled a 60ft root to the entrance of the hut.

Gilgan flew in and opened up a hole in the floorboards where a green light glowed, protected by a vicious wooden maw. Oink bravely grabbed into the void and pulled out a magic gem, which rendered the hut powerless.

Gilgan finished off the swamp witch with a mighty bolt of radiant energy. Gilgan distributed some loot he retrieved after a glyph of warding exploded in his face.

Kavi got some new pipes, Rollo got a lucky stone, and Gilgan got some blade oil. Kavi learned about the fate of Berez from Lazlo the last Burgomaster.

Gilgan found Marina’s bow at the base of her monument, and has just finished off a swarm of bloated corpses filled with snakes…
