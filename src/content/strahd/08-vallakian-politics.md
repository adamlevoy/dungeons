Last time, Kavi entertained the Blue Water Inn with a tale. The party met a traveling ringmaster named Rictavio who was vacationing in Barovia. Rickie invited them to visit his tower east of Lake Zarovich. The party debated their next move, worrying that the obsidian battleaxe would be a giveaway to their involvement in Izek’s demise, Gilgan stuffed the axe in Kavi’s bagpipes for safekeeping. The team then decided to attend a dinner party at Vachterhaus where they received a proposal. They brought news of this proposal to the Burgomaster who enlisted their services with the town security. Oink discovered the Burgomaster’s son dabbling with dark magic in the attic. With all the goings on, the group felt that the Church of St. Andral would be the safest place for them to rest. Caryn met Father Lucian Petrovich, and Gilgan met a jolly fellow named Blinksy. Now we return to the dilemma, will the party get involved in Vallakian politics? or will they move on in search of greener pastures? This DM will not even try to guess what happens next on ‘THE CURSE OF STRAHD’...
